# BDD/TDD for Dynamics 365 CE

This project contains samples to show you how you can use BDD and TDD for Dynamics 365 CE projects.

As patterns emerge we can then package these into a re-usable framework.

## Getting Started

To open and run the sample you will need:
* Visual Studio 2017
* SpecFlow [Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TechTalkSpecFlowTeam.SpecFlowforVisualStudio2017) for Visual Studio 2017
* A Dynamics 365 CE Instance
* 3 Environment variables at user level (CrmUsername, CrmPassword, CrmUrl)

## Sample Contents

The sample contains the following projects

### Acceptance Tests

This is based on UI Automation tests using [EasyRepro](https://github.com/Microsoft/EasyRepro) Framework.

### System Tests

This is based on integration tests using CRM SDK Services.

### Unit Tests

This is based on the [FakeXrmEasy](https://github.com/jordimontana82/fake-xrm-easy) Unit Testing Framework
